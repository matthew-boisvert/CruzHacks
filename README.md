# Lecture++

![slug image](https://github.com/matthew-boisvert/CruzHacks/blob/master/slugs/yellowslugwithspeech.png?s=200)

Lecture++ is a JavaScript P2P (Peer-To-Peer) text-based chat application that can be used by students to communicate with their instructors more easily during class. By going to the website at [https://matthew-boisvert.github.io/CruzHacks/public/](https://matthew-boisvert.github.io/CruzHacks/public/), an instructor can create a local chatroom for students to connect to and ask questions during class.

Lecture++ was developed in order to address two major academic accessibility issues in large lecture hall environments:

 1. When students have a difficult time voicing their questions during lectures
 2. When instructors have hearing impairments

Using our application, we hope that it will be simple and convenient for students and teachers to have an intuitive method for communicating during lectures. It will also make it easier for teachers to know which questions students are generally confused about and need help with.

## How to use

*Instructor Use:* In order to use this application, an instructor can go to our website and display the QR code for students to scan and connect to. Students can also use the provided shortened link to connect to the website and then ask questions. These questions are then displayed to the instructor and all students for easy access in large lectures.

*Student Use*: Students can connect to the provided web application by scanning the QR code displayed by the instructor as well as a QR code shown on another student's screen after they have already connected. From there, students can ask the instructor questions anonymously as well as answer each other's questions live during lecture.

## Future Updates
In the near future, these are the features that we would like to add to this application in order to make it as useful and user-friendly as possible:

 1. Question moderation system to filter communications
 2. Question ranking system to mitigate repeat questions and make it easier to search through the inquiries
 3. Minimalist U.I. design
